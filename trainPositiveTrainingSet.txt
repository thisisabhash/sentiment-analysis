1	Though structured totally different from the book by Tim Krabb√© who wrote the original The Vanishing Spoorloos it does have the same overall feel except for that Koolhovens style is less businesslike and more lyric The beginning is great the middle is fine but the sting is in the end A surprise emotional ending As you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully Never explicit but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour It is a shame American films cant be as open an honoust as this one Where Dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject De Grot stays always within the boundaries of good taste De Grot tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years When youll leave the cinema youll be moved What can we ask more of a film Anyway this film even gives more
1	Ah the 1970s A time when it was in to be a swinger To be honest today is also a good time to be a swinger but it just felt more daring thenbr br Joe Sarno offers up a pretty good softcore film In fact just like today some of the actors are famous hardcore actors Unlike today these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character developmentbr br Its pretty much what you would expect out of a swingers movie Two couples with open relationships reignite the wanderlust out of the MILF of one of the women who has come for a visit Not much more to itbr br Of course when the MILF is Jennifer Welles then it is a different story Not too many 40somethings look as delicious undressed as Ms Welles Its worth the price alone to see Ms Welles look at herself in the mirror as if shes Aphrodite Shes no Stiflers Mom Shes way sexierbr br I also digged Chris Jordans Anna Jordan looks and sounds so much like Elaine Joyce that I thought she might be her separated at birth twin or even Elaine herself Anna is always eating but must have incredible metabolismbr br Unlike 1990s softcore porn 70s softie porn retained the hardcore films realism something that 2000s softcore has brought back on occasion instead of the 90s music and canned orgasms and it is here in full force Its not real but it feels realbr br For those who enjoyed the Quebec produced Deux Femmes En Or youll enjoy this one Another classic film only on DriveIn Classics the best 250 CAN a month you can spend
1	Dark Angel is a futuristic scifi series set in postapocalyptic Seattle centering on Max Jessica Alba a genetically enhanced young woman on the run from her creatorsbr br The Dark Angel universe is absorbing not as much as say Buffy but absorbing nonetheless with an interesting and believable set of characters Certainly it is not for everyone but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable series out there Dark Angel is criminally overlooked and underrated and was unfortunatly canceled after only 2 series Which was a great shame as this had the potential to become a great series although its 42 episodes are only 10 shy of long running BBC scifi comedy Red Dwarf As it is Dark Angel remains unfinished so seek it out and if you want more lobby Fox to make another series
1	I first discovered Alexander Kordas 1940 Fantasy THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in the early 1950s on a reissue billed as The Wonder Show of the Century Both Korda Technicolor films THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on one never to be forgotten program The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made As the years passed it became more difficult to enjoy the films color in the way it had originally been presented in True Technicolor gave way to a Eastman Color process in the middle 1950s Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video But the Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original Technicolor The Laser Disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it nice but not as it should be NOW comes the MGM DVD 3 Dec 2002 issue THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful Technicolor look to it on a DVD that is nothing short of STUNNING It was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the DVD once I watched it a second time The only Extras are a Spanish Dubbed version SubTitles in both English Spanish and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer Thank you MGM for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release Now one can only hope that Kordas FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Kordas JUNGLE BOOK to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation will soon follow on DVD
