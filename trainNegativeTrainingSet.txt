0	When I spotted that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie I was like score I admit I was eager to see the movie And I have to say the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way Then it went all down hill I didnt expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo They took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story I was appalled that Noah was involved in anything of the sort especially his role Nobody with a fully functional brain would actually accept all that crap about the Vietnam War If anyone really wants to know how Communism was like sit down and read a book on it And not one that praises it or is against it just the cold hard factsbr br I only watched a few scenes here and there only because I wanted to see Rickys body but that was all that interested me Everything else about this movie irritated me
0	I just saw the movie in theater The movie has very few good points to talk about Kareenas beauty and a couple of songs may be Thats it The movie is a complete disappointment in all areas Anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed even Mumbai Indians too just now Chennai has made it to semifinal br br But the worst I feel about the movie is the action scenes Now days Bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from Hollywood But they forget that Hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real But unfortunately Bollywood directors do not have that much of time They spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie Now such too stupid action scenes may work in South as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people But in Bollywood this is certainly not going to work All the action scenes I wish I could have forwarded At the end even some Chinese people appear from nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar This is height of stupidity Audience is not paying to watch such stupidity I think Bollywood now should forget about the action movies They cant make it The last good action I have seen was from Ghatak and Khiladiyon ka Khialdi The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me Does these people see their movie after completion Cant they figure out that the slow motion action which is done using ropes is too unrealistic and childish Better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it I just want to go back to Amitabhs era where movie like Zanjeer and Deewar were having thrilling action scenes The sound effect was not very effective in those days but visually it is much better than current era scenes br br This movie now should open the eyes of the Bollywood movie directors Please dont make any more action movies until you acquire the art of making it realistic
0	I have seen some bad movies Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me Batman Forever but this film is so awful so BORING that I got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest A pity Boasting talent such as Kenneth Branagh Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a story by John Grisham what went wrong Branagh is a bigtime lawyer who has a onenight fling with Davitz Her father Duvall is a psychopath who hanged her cat etc etc so Branagh has him sent to a nuthouse and he promptly escapes Somehow I couldnt figure out how Robert Downey jr Daryl Hannah Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary I wanted to like this and being a huge Grisham fan have read all about this movie and I foolishly expected something interesting This is honestly the WORST film Ive seen to date and I wish I could have my money refunded out of
0	A friend of mine lent this video to me and I was fairly excited to watch it but after ten minutes of James Hetfields slow pitched vocals and Lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion I began to think Why am I watching this That question will be coursing through your minds in 5 Â– 10 minutes after you hit Play I gave the tape back the same day as you would suspect not worth buying or watchingbr br Just my opinionbr br
0	This is quite possibly the most retarded 80s slasher ever realized but how can you be harsh on a film that features nonstop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits Prior to being a horror film Aerobicide is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids silicons and other bodystimulating fitness products If youd leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80s tunes there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left Plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young healthfreaks with a big safety pin yeah The film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sunbathing device Several years later people turn up dead in the same spa You dont really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out theres a link between the murders and the burning incident now do you Investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer and Charles Napier lookalike and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80s beauty Ive ever seen Looking through the credits her names Dianne Copeland apparently and she didnt do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile Tromamovie called Surf Nazis Must Die What a wasted opportunity She may not have been a great actress but she sure had two other BIG advantages that would help her move upwards in show business The amount of gore and the quality of the makeup effects are nothing special neither Were treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh The plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore anyway Aerobicide aka Killer Workout is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night but nevertheless feel like watching a film It actually would make a terrific doublefeature with Death Spa Both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes and both films are pretty dumb
